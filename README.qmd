#### Abstract

Large collections of related time series often use attributes that identify their relation to other series. These attributes typically relate to what is being measured, such as product categories or store locations for the sales of a product over time. Aggregating across these attributes produces additional time series that offer useful overviews of the data. Forecast reconciliation uses these aggregations to improve forecasting accuracy. When there exists many attributes for time series data, the number of series in the collection quickly grows. This presents many problems for forecasting, since producing many forecasts can be computationally infeasible and the forecast accuracy for aggregated series of interest can worsen.

To overcome these problems I propose using time series features to identify noisy, uninformative, or otherwise unwanted series and leveraging graph representations of aggregation constraints to safely remove them while preserving coherency structures. In this talk I will introduce pruning coherency constraints using graphs and demonstrate how graph search algorithms can be used to efficiently identify and remove uninformative subgraphs of time series while maintaining coherency. Pruning subgraphs of time series from the collection can substantially reduce the number of series to forecast, while retaining most of the information. This helps limit the computational complexity of forecasting, while improving forecast accuracy for aggregated series due to reduced model misspecification in more disaggregated series.
